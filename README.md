Make-a-thon
===========

An intense 48 hour, non-stop competition where the top most makers, designers and developers across India get together and hack on the most difficult problems as a team with lots of hardware and software resources in the room. Participants can hack on problem statements posted by the partner companies or specific technologies posted by them. Participants can also elect to work on out of the box problems.
